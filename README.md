# Go API to access the TP-Link HS110 SmartPlug
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gittycat/smartplug)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gittycat/smartplug)

Work in progress..

Simple, idiomatic and working API to query and control a TP-Link HS100 or HS110 smartplug. The focus is on presenting the minimum code needed to control the smartplug. A sample application is included.

## Setup

TODO: Complete

## Credits
The encryption and decryption is based on the python code from SoftsCheck

This API is possible due to the reverse engineering work done
by Lubomir Stroetmann and Tobias Esser at SoftsCheck.
