# Go API to access the TP-Link HS110 SmartPlug
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gittycat/smartplug)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gittycat/smartplug)


Simple, idiomatic and working API to access a TP-Link HS100 or HS110 smartplug. 

The focus is on presenting the minimum code needed to query the smartplug. There are about 
[50 calls documented](https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug/blob/master/tplink-smarthome-commands.txt) to control the device. Only a handful of calls are 
implemented here although extending it should be fairly trivial.

## How to Use

Here's a minimal program to retrieve Power and Current metrics.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/gittycat/smartplug"
)

func main() {
	p := smartplug.NewSmartplug("192.168.1.9", "9999") // ip, port
	info, err := p.Meter()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Power: %d mW  Current: %d mA\n", info.PowerMw, info.CurrentMa)
}
```

The included `example/example.go` program shows how to retrieve the metrics at intervals.



## Credits
The encryption and decryption is based on the [python code from SoftsCheck]
(https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug)

This API is possible due to the reverse engineering work done
by Lubomir Stroetmann and Tobias Esser at SoftsCheck.

They also include a command line python app to query and control the device.
